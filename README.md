# Ryan's ID Assignment --> Band Website - Imagine Dragons 

For this assignment, I have created a website for one of the most popular band in the world - Imagine Dragons. 

A short introduction of Imagine Dragons. They have sold more than 75 million records worldwide. They were the most streamed group of 2018 on Spotify and are the first rock act to have four songs, "Radioactive", "Demons", "Believer" and "Thunder", to surpass one billion streams each. It comprises of the 4 members - Dan Reynolds, Daniel Platzman, Wayne Sermon and Ben  Mckee. 

From the introduction of the band to the elaboration of the band's history by their albums, display of their music videos and booking for their concert evnets, readers are able to accomplish these tasks all in one site. 
 
## Design Process



I decided to split the website into 5 different sections to porvide greater clarity for the purpose of each page: 

- Page One > Home > Fans will be able to immediately identify the main band of this wesbite - Imagine Dragons. They are greeted with the big band title, followed by a section containing a brief description of the band and lastly, a image gallery of the band in the format of a slideshow.
    - In the first page, there is the title of Imagine Dragons with a background. Next, there is a 2 grid column with the left column holding the image of the 4 members and the other column providing a brief description of the band. There is a click more button for the users to explore more about the band. 

- Page Two > History > For fans who are curious about how the band was etablished and what are the ups and downs they have went through throughout their career, here is a page for them. 










Apps which I have used to design include: 
1. Adobe XD (Wireframe): <link>

Target Audience and their Purpose of visiting this Website:
1. Regular readers who wants to know a little on what the band, Imagine Dragons is about such as the songs they produce.
2. Fans and readers who are curious and interested to find out more about the band history as well as its members.
3. Fans and readers to want to purchase and book tickets for imagine dragon events such as their concert. 
4. Fans and readers who wants to listen into the music or watch their music video as they are all consolidated into one section without any advertisements 
   


I decided to apply what we have learnt during lessons such as forms, media queries, 
 




Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features
In Page One:
  -

## Testing


- Completed 
    - The media query is used in the format for iphone 6/7/8.


- Incomplete: 
    1. For the media query of the playlist page, the social media bar is stuck in the middle of the page together with the video list.
    2. Media queries **might** not work as intended for the other dimensions. 

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.




In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
