# Ryan's ID Assignment --> Band Website - Imagine Dragons

For this assignment, I have created a website for one of the most popular band in the world - Imagine Dragons. 

A short introduction of Imagine Dragons. They have sold more than 75 million records worldwide. They were the most streamed group of 2018 on Spotify and are the first rock act to have four songs, "Radioactive", "Demons", "Believer" and "Thunder", to surpass one billion streams each. It comprises of the 4 members - Dan Reynolds, Daniel Platzman, Wayne Sermon and Ben Mckee. 

Did you know the name "Imagine Dragons" is an anagram. (Ps. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.)

From the introduction of the band to the elaboration of the band's history, display of their music videos and reservation for their concert events, readers are able to accomplish these tasks all in one site. 

## Design Process

Target Audience + Purpose:
  1. Readers who wants to know a little on what the band, Imagine Dragons is about, such as the songs they produce.
  2. Fans and readers who are curious and interested to find out more about the band history as well as its members.
  3. Fans and readers to want to purchase and book tickets for imagine dragon events such as their concert. 
  4. Fans and readers who wants to listen into the music or watch their music video as they are all consolidated into one section without any advertisements 

As there are much information about the website, I decided to focus on the important yet relevant content about the band, mainly the band's history, their videos and music and last but not least their concert events. Thus, I have split the contents into 5 separate sections/pages for better clarity and each page serves a different purpose.


- All
    - Navigate throughout the website using an animated navigation bar with a glow effect
    - Access the band social media platform using the social media bar consisting of their Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and twitter links. 
    - Attributing the author in the footer box. 

- Page One > Home 
    - Identify what the website is about: Huge Title.
    - Briefly understand what the band is and who does it consists of: image of the band and a short description about the band.
    - Scroll and admire the images about the band: image slideshow with 9 different band images.

- Page Two > History 
    - Summarize the purpose of the page: Huge Header.
    - Understand and learn more about the different chapters of the band's history: collapsible bars/buttons with the respective content.
    - Know more about the different members of the band: 4 different images with the overlay effect containing the information about the members. 

- Page Three > Playlist
    - Summarize the purpose of the page: Huge Header.
    - Watch and listen to the selected band music video: main video frame (2 frames)
    - Select what videos to watch or listen and chill: video selection list with scroll effect (1 frame)

- Page Four > Events
    - Summarize the purpose of the page: Huge Header.
    - Learn about the different details of the concerts: orange right box
    - Book and pay for their reservation: book now button
    - Sidenote: The different row boxes are made to resemble the concert tickets. 

- Page Five > Feedback
    - Thank the readers for making it till the end: Huge Title
    - Collect suggestion on the improvement of the website: Form Page + ratings function with emojis


With the wireframes created, I use the idea to build up my website and add in the basic content for the website. In the following weeks, I then implement more animations and interaction with the readers. I focus more on the experience on the desktop compared to the mobile version as I feel that there is a higher amount of web users accessing the website compared to mobile users. 

I made use of what we have learnt during lessons such as semantic html, media queries and form creation. W3schools and lesson slides are used as reference during the build-up of the website. 

The colours used throughout the website include black (#000000), white(#FFFFFF), neon orange(#FF7200) and grey(#4b4b4b). The navigation bar, social media bars and footer is used throughout the website. Font-size and button animation are used consistently throughout the website. 

Apps which I have used to design include: 
1. Adobe XD (Wireframe): As Attached in the file or in GitHub

7. Ratings with Emoji (Feedback - Fifth)
