        <h3>Early Years (2008-2010)</h3>
        <p>
        In 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brigham Young University, where they were both students. They recruited Aurora Florence, Dave Lemke, and Andrew Beck for their band (Dan Reynolds acted as lead vocalist, Andrew Tolman was the drummer, Aurora Florence acted as the violinist and vocalist, Dave Lemke was the guitarist, and Andrew Beck acted the keyboardist and volcalist). The original band recorded an unofficial album, Speak To Me, and 7 demos (which were given to a fan by Aurora and later recovered in July 2017). Aurora Florence and Andrew Beck left after less than a year. In 2009, Tolman recruited longtime high school friend Daniel Wayne Sermon, who had recently returned to his hometown of American Fork, Utah from the Berklee College of Music. Tolman later recruited his wife, Brittany Tolman, to sing backup and play keys. Sermon then recruited another Berklee music student, Ben McKee, to join the band after recording their first EP from this lineup, Imagine Dragons (EP). With Reynolds singing lead, Imagine Dragons won BYUâ€™s "Battle of the Bands" and other local competitions. The band released another EP titled Hell and Silence in 2010, recorded at Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas, NV.
        They got their first big break when Train's frontman fell sick just prior to the Bite of Las Vegas Festival 2010. Imagine Dragons were called to fill in and performed to a crowd of more than 26,000 people. Local accolades including "Best Local Indie Band 2010" (Las Vegas Weekly), "Las Vegas' Newest Must See Live Act" (Las Vegas CityLife),Vegas Music Summit Headliner 2010, and more sent the band on a positive trajectory.[2]

        The band finished recording their debut album Night Visions in the summer of 2012 at Studio X inside Palms Casino Resort and released the album in the United States on the day after Labor Day (September 4, 2012). It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales in excess of 83,000 copies, the highest charting for a debut rock album since 2006. The album also reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative and Rock Album charts as well as the top ten on the Australian, Austrian, Canadian, Dutch, German, Irish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scottish, Spanish, and United Kingdom Albums charts. It won a Billboard Music Award for Top Rock Album and was nominated for the Juno Award for International Album of the Year.

The album produced three tracks that reached the Billboard Top 40, four tracks in the ARIA Top 40, and five tracks charting in the UK Top 40.
        The band embarked on the Night Visions Tour in 2013. The album's second single "Radioactive" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs, Billboard Rock Songs, and Swedish singles chart and has sold more than seven million singles in the United States, smashing a record by spending 87 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. "Radioactive" stayed at No. 1 on the Hot Rock Songs chart for a record-breaking 23 weeks and ultimately became the genre's biggest hit of 2013.[38] It peaked at No. 3, becoming their first top ten single in the United States and broke the record for the longest run into the top five. It is the best-selling rock song on the Nielsen SoundScan running list of best-selling rock songs in digital history.[39] By the end of 2013, "Radioactive" had already sold over 3 million copies.[40] Rolling Stone called it "the biggest rock hit of the year".

        <p>
        The idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their "New Year's resolution",[52] was to create music and finish it when the band feels that their work is done.[53] Since the beginning of the Night Visions Tour, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, before entering the studio.[54] By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work from.[55]

        Working with Metric, which did a three-song acoustic set, Imagine Dragons played at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles on February 5, 2015. The half-hour set included the breakthrough songs "It's Time" and "Radioactive" from Night Visions. The performance was the live debut for "Summer" and "I'm So Sorry", along with "Gold" and "I Bet My Life" from the album Smoke + Mirrors, which was released on February 17, 2015. The band's 2015 North American summer tour began in Portland, Oregon on June 3.
        During the band's tour, Imagine Dragons released two non-album singles. "Roots" was released on August 26, 2015 and "I Was Me" on October 12, 2015 via iTunes.

        <h2>Mercury - Act 1 (2020-present)</h2>
        <p>
        A year and a half after the release of Origins, Ben announced they were working on a new album and it was going to be the best one. When they ended the record, Dan said he "loved this record the most".
        The first snippets of the album appeared on 4 secret videos which got posted in Imagine Dragons's YouTube channel after they were found. These videos would give a lot of hints during the album's cycle, for example, there were many Mercury references and that hinted the album's title.
        On March 8, 2021, Imagine Dragons announced a dual single featuring Follow You and Cutthroat, very different from each other. Not long after that, they said "the new album would have two sides, one looking to the world and the people around Dan (Follow You side) and the other one looking at Dan's emotions and inner world (Cutthroat side), with one song at the end that tied both sides. He also said the title of the album was going to reflect the themes of duality of the album. At that moment, they hadn't decided to split the album in two yet.
        Very shortly after, 19 songs were registered on BMI and ASCAP. 8 of these songs were left out, and out of the 11 remaining ones, two songs were renamed (Number One got renamed to #1 and Beautiful Day got renamed to No Time For Toxic People).
        On June 29, 2021, a new single, Wrecked (which got registered on BMI before), was announced, expected to release on July 2. Its artwork hinted it was gonna be from the Cutthroat side of the album. That same day, a tweet from the band was posted. It was a black image with white text reading "IF ANYONE GUESSES THE ALBUM TITLE TONIGHT, WE WILL ANNOUNCE IT TOMORROW". The most popular guess was Today And Tomorrow, but someone went on saying Mercury. And that was the album's title, but it wasn't just Mercury. The full title was Mercury - Act 1. It was going to have 13 songs (with Wrecked as track 3, Follow You as track 10 and Cutthroat as track 11) and was expected to release on September 3. A few weeks after, Dan almost confirmed there was gonna be an Act 2 with the song that was going to tie both sides.
        Dan said Mercury - Act 1 had that title because the word "mercurial" means "characterized by rapid and unpredictable changeableness of mood". They changed the title to Mercury to make it easier to remember and to make it sound more like a world.
        On mid July 2021, a new song, No Time For Toxic People, appeared at a Jeep commercial.
        The tracklist and song lengths were revealed on August 20, 2021, two weeks before Mercury - Act 1's release. Fans had guessed most of the tracklist before by looking the producer list on Apple Music and a low-resolution Target tracklist picture, but still they didn't know that two songs had been renamed. The renames were discovered when the tracklist was announced.
        The next day, they released a self-titled single under the name Ragged Insomnia, which was gonna help finding a password for the #MercuryAscending hashtag. Alexa was a very useful hint to help fans get that password, it turned out to be "everybody is a genius". That week was very intense; some snippets were revealed too, along with the lyrics of Dull Knives, one of the songs that were gonna appear on Mercury - Act 1. It also was confirmed that Mercury - Act 1 wasn't gonna have any deluxe versions.
        Not long after the album release, the Mercury tour was announced, it was starting on early February 2022.
