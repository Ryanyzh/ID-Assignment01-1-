        <h3>Early Years (2008-2010)</h3>
        <p>
        In 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brigham Young University, where they were both students. 
        They recruited Aurora Florence, Dave Lemke, and Andrew Beck for their band (Dan Reynolds acted as lead vocalist, Andrew Tolman was the drummer, Aurora Florence acted as the violinist and vocalist, Dave Lemke was the guitarist, and Andrew Beck acted the keyboardist and volcalist). 
        The original band recorded an unofficial album, Speak To Me, and 7 demos (which were given to a fan by Aurora and later recovered in July 2017). 
        Aurora Florence and Andrew Beck left after less than a year.

        <h3>Night Visions (2012-2014)</h3>
        <p>
        Theresa Flaminio departed from Imagine Dragons in early 2012, leaving them as a four-piece. 
        The band worked closely with Alex da Kid, with whom they recorded their first major label release at Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California. 
        An EP entitled Continued Silence was released on Valentine's Day (February 14, 2012) digitally and peaked at number 40 on the Billboard 200. 
        The band also released an EP titled Hear Me in 2012.
        Shortly after, "It's Time" was released as a single and peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100.
        The music video debuted on April 17, 2012 on all MTV affiliates and was subsequently nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the "Best Rock Video" category.

        <h3>Smoke + Mirrors (2014-2016)</h3>
        <p>
        The idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their "New Year's resolution", was to create music and finish it when the band feels that their work is done. 
        Since the beginning of the Night Visions Tour, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, before entering the studio. 
        By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work from.
        Imagine Dragons released a number of singles for other projects including a song for the film Transformers: Age of Extinction, called "Battle Cry" (June 2014) and song "Warriors" for the 2014 League of Legends World Championship (September 2014).

        <h3>Evolve (2016-2018)</h3>
        <p>
        On September 27, 2016, Imagine Dragons began teasing their third studio album with a tweet simply saying "studio". 
        The band continued posting cryptic messages on their Twitter account for the next four months. 
        On January 28, 2017, the band started posting a series of videos teasing the album's first single. 
        The time-lapse videos featured lead singer Dan Reynolds drawing surreal images on a drawing pad. 
        Morse code was hidden in the videos and translated to "objects of same color".
        On February 1, 2017, Imagine Dragons released "Believer" as the lead single for their next album.

        <h3>Origins (2018-2020)</h3>
        <p>
        On June 12, 2018, Imagine Dragons announced a new single in collaboration with Kygo titled "Born to Be Yours" on Twitter. 
        The song was released on June 15, 2018.
        On July 12, 2018, Imagine Dragons announced a new single titled "Natural" on Twitter. 
        The song was released on July 17, 2018. 
        The song was used as the anthem for the 2018 ESPN College Football season. 
        On September 18, 2018, Imagine Dragons announced a new single titled "Zero", which was released on September 19, 2018.

        <h4>Mercury - Act 1 (2020-present)</h4>
        <p>
        A year and a half after the release of Origins, Ben announced they were working on a new album and it was going to be the best one. 
        When they ended the record, Dan said he "loved this record the most".
        The first snippets of the album appeared on 4 secret videos which got posted in Imagine Dragons's YouTube channel after they were found. 
        These videos would give a lot of hints during the album's cycle, for example, there were many Mercury references and that hinted the album's title.
        On March 8, 2021, Imagine Dragons announced a dual single featuring Follow You and Cutthroat, very different from each other.
